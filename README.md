# SaltCreep
This repo contains all code related to Deep Learning algorithms used to predict salt composition.
# Data
We are not uploading the data folder as of now; we plan to release it in the future
# Steps
We first process the images using ImageContour - data.ipynb for NH4Cl and other salts.
Next, we use the preprocessed images and apply Deep learning algorithms (CNN, and RESNET-50) [The code related to this section along with output can be found here Saltcreep.ipynb]
